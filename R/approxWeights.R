#' Monte Carlo approximation of chi-bar-square weights
#'
#' Approximation of the chi-bar-square weigths via Monte Carlo approximation.
#'
#' The chi-bar-square distribution \eqn{\bar{\chi}^2(I,C)} is a mixture of chi-square distributions. The function provides
#' a method to approximate the weights of the mixture components, when the number of components is known as well as the
#' degrees of freedom of each chi-square distribution in the mixture, and given a vector of simulated values from the target
#' \eqn{\bar{\chi}^2(I,C)} distribution. Let us assume that there are \eqn{p} components in the mixture, with degrees of
#' freedom between \eqn{n_1} and \eqn{n_p}. By definition of a mixture distribution, we have :
#' \deqn{ \mathbb{P}(\bar{\chi}^2(I,C) \leq c) = \sum_{i=n_1}^{n_p} w_i \mathbb{P}(\chi^2_{i} \leq c)}
#' Choosing \eqn{p-2} values \eqn{c_1, \dots, c_{p-2}}, the function will generate a system of \eqn{p-2} equations
#' according to the above relationship, and add two additional relationships stating that the sum of all the weights is
#' equal to 1, and that the sum of odd weights and of even weights is equal to 1/2, so that we end up with a system a \eqn{p}
#' equations with \eqn{p} variables.
